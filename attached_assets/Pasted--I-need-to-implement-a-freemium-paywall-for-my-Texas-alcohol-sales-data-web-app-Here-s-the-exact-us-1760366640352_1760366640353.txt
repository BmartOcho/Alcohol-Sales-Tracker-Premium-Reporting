"I need to implement a freemium paywall for my Texas alcohol sales data web app. Here's the exact user experience I want:
INITIAL EXPERIENCE (No login required):

User lands on page and IMMEDIATELY sees the interactive map with all data visible
Map shows ALL locations as pins/markers (not blurred)
User can click on map and see top 10 results per county, sorted by sales volume
Each result shows: business name, address, and total monthly sales
Search bar is visible and functional at the top

FREE USER LIMITS (Before requiring sign-in):

After user clicks on 3 specific businesses (not counties, but individual bars/restaurants), trigger the paywall
Track these 3 clicks in browser localStorage (so it persists across page refreshes)
On the 4th click, apply blur effect to the data display
Show modal overlay: 'Sign in to see unlimited searches and full data access'
County top-10 lists remain visible even after 3 clicks (only individual business detail views count toward limit)

VISUAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Use CSS blur filter (blur(8px)) on data sections when limit reached
Modal should be centered, not dismissible (no X button), with two buttons: 'Sign In' and 'Create Account'
Show counter: 'X searches remaining' after each click (e.g., '2 searches remaining')
Make the counter prominent but not annoying

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:

Track click count in localStorage with key 'searchCount'
Store list of clicked business IDs to prevent counting same business multiple times
Reset counter daily at midnight (store timestamp in localStorage)
Make sure the map and top-10 lists are immediately visible on page load (no loading states that slow first impression)

EDGE CASES TO HANDLE:

What if user clears localStorage? (Reset counter)
What if user opens in incognito? (Fresh counter, that's fine)
Mobile responsive design for the modal
Make sure blur effect doesn't break layout

MY CURRENT TECH STACK: [Insert your actual stack - e.g., 'React frontend, Node.js backend, PostgreSQL database, Mapbox for maps']
Please provide the complete code implementation including:

The localStorage tracking logic
The blur CSS and modal HTML/JSX
The click handler that increments the counter
The modal component
How to integrate this with my existing [map component/search function]"
